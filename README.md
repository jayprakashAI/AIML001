"""
The problem statement goes below
    There is bag that contains 3 colours of ball (Red, Green & Blue)
    Numbers of ball count of each colours are A, B, and C respectively
    We will 3 picks and in each pick we will take 2 balls out and we won’t replace the picked balls for subsequent picks or draws.
    We wanted to find out the probability of picking same of colour of balls in 3rd draw.
    You are NOT allowed to use “conditional probability” formulae to solve this, instead solve algorithmically using data structure.
